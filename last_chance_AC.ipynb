    "# Catching Last Chance Critters in Animal Crossing: New Horizons\n",

    "\n",
    "One of your main goals in the new Animal Crossing: New Horizons for Nintendo Switch it to complete your Critterpedia by catching every type of insect and fish on your own desert island. Many of these creatures are seasonal, so it's a very good idea to understand what you'll need to catch each month before it's too late and you have to wait months before they become available again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Big thanks to Polygon for providing their complete [insect](https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/24/21191276/insect-bug-locations-times-month-day-list-critterpedia) and [fish](https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/23/21190775/fish-locations-times-month-day-list-critterpedia) guides as the data for this project, and to Nintendo for making one of the best games of 2020 already.\n",
