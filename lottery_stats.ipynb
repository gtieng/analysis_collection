    "# Exploring Lottery Logic\n",
    "**by Gerard Tieng**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will be demonstrating our skills in statistics and probability with the exploration of potential outcomes in a lottery. We will assume the role of a data specialist who will build the main logical core of a mobile app, commissioned by a medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective will be to explain the almost near impossible probabilities behind lottery participation in order to deter further gambling addiction. We will answer the probability of winning with a single ticket, multiple tickets, and matching subsets of numbers within the winning set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lottery rules in this case is based on a 6 number draw without replacement from a range of 1-49 inclusive. Additionally, [lottery records](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) from Canada's national drawings from 1982-2018 will be used in this project to complement theoretical probabilites with real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Essential Formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with probabilities, there two main algebraic equations which prove essential for considering total outcomes: factorials and combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorials, expressed as `n!`, allows us to see the number of total unique outcomes (permutations) when selecting items from a set one-by-one without repitition. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`5! = 5*4*3*2*1 or 120 permuations`"
